This project is a simple password template generator.
The point is that the generator will create and save patterns.
The patterns use generic characters, which act like string variables.
The actual value of each string is to be remembered by the user.
Essentially, the user remebers a list of strings, and these are then
combined in random order with special characters between.

This way, not only can the user make sure to use different patterns
for each of their password, but there is no way to actually know what
the password is just by looking at a pattern. Only the user knows
what the pattern translates to.
